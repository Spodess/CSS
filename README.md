# CSS

These are my compiled CSS' different websites currently, I don't take credit for all of them as some are from userstyles but some I made myself as I started learning CSS, I mainly use this to store them. They all follow a dark theme (most with a red finish with the hex #d65a61 and #1c1c1c as the background). You can install them with Stylish or any other way you know of.
