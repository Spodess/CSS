# CSS

A compilation of CSS styles that are either sourced from myself or others. The Discord CSS is my largest style sheet I've made thus far with several updates over the months. Recently, my friend, "MrKingMichael", has been helping by cleaning up the Discord code and contributing to the development of the style sheet.
